## About the game ##

The game Connect Four is designed for two players who take turns placing their discs into one of seven columns. A playing field consists of six rows and seven columns
in which the discs stack up on each other. Every player has 21 discs. The goal of the game is to get 4 of the same-colored discs (in this case same symbols) in a row
(horizontally, vertically or diagonally). In case there are no more discs left and neither player has won it is called a stalemate and the game is over.
